# Principals-Of-Programming-Projects

This repository contains two distinct programming projects: one developed in Java and the other in C.

## Java Program: Code Analyzer

This console application reads Java files (*.java), identifying functions and associated comments.

- Identifies all functions within a Java file.
- Captures single-line, multi-line, and Javadoc comments.
- Quantifies each comment type per function, displaying the counts.
- Stores comments in three separate files: `javadoc.txt`, `teksatir.txt`, `coksatir.txt`.
- Supports variable numbers of functions and comments for flexibility.

## C Program: Colonies War Simulation

A Mingw (gcc) based simulation where users input colony populations to initiate warfare.

- Requests user input for colony populations at startup.
- Simulates combat using distinct tactics, with outcomes influencing resources.
- Incorporates unique production techniques for each colony's food stock.
- Continues until a single colony remains, displaying the victor.
- Emphasizes OOP simulation, modular programming, and function pointers.

Each project is designed to demonstrate specific programming principles and problem-solving strategies.
